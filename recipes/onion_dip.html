    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Dips are the way to get a party started, and this caramelized onion dip 
        will be the first one to disappear. Caramelizing onions releases their 
        natural sugars, and smoky bacon complements that sweetness, making this 
        dip really special. Serve with crackers, chips, crostini, carrots, celery, 
        or radishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.25 pounds sweet onions (such as Vidalia), halved and clicked 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 slices bacon</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsalmic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chooped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, nonstick skillet, heat oil and butter over medium heat.
            Stir in onions, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook until onions
            soften and become translucent, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and, stirring occasionally, cook onions until
            golden brown but not crisp, 40 to 50 minutes.  If the pan starts to get
            too dry, reduce the heat and add 1 tablespoon water.  Let onions cool to
            room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat
            until crisp, about 10 minutes.  Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble
            when cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, and yogurt. Beat
            with an electric mixer until smooth.  Stir in balsalmic vinegar and bacon.
            Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Fold in caramelized onions until evenly distributed. Refrigerate dip for 
            at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, before serving. Garnish with
            chopped parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>You cannot speed up the carmelization process by cooking at a higher temperature
        for fewer minutes.  Low and slow is the way to go, patience is required, and You
        will be rewarded with one of the tasiest dips you've ever had.
