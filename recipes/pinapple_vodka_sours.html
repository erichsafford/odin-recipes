    <p>Channel your inner mixologist with infused vodka and homemade sour mix,
        then shake them together for a sweet-tart sipper you can call your own.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>Pineapple-Basil Vodka</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>1 (750-mL) bottle vodka</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DIY Sour Mix</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly-squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Additional</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ice as needed</li>
        <li>Club soda as needed (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh pineapple wedges and fronds, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>For pineapple-basil vodka, put pineapple in a 1-quart jar. Top with
            vodka, cover, and let stand until vodka is infused with pinapple 
            flavor, 1 to 3 days.  Add basil, cover and infuse for 1 to 2 hours; 
            strain.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, for the DIY sour mix, combine sugar and water in a 
                saucepan and bring to a boil over high head, stirring until sugar
                is dissolved.  Remove from heat; let cool. Add lime juice and
                lemon juice.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and
                up to 1 week.</p>
        </li>
        <li>In a pitcher, stir together pineapple-basil vodka and DIY sour mix.
            Serve in rocks glasses over ice.  Top with club soda (if using); 
            garnish with pineapple wedges, fronds, and additional basil.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>Consider this the only vodka sour recipe you'll ever need.  For a single
        cocktail, shake together 1 1/2 ounce pinapple-basil vodka and 1 1/2 ounce
        DIY sour mix in a shaker, then strain and serve over ice.
